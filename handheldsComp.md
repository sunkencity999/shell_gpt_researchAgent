## Research Goal
Which gaming handheld is superior, the Nintendo Switch 2 or the Steam Deck OLED?

## Executive Summary
Based on the provided research summaries, it is difficult to definitively conclude which gaming handheld is superior between the Nintendo Switch 2 and the Steam Deck OLED. However, we can draw some inferences and highlight key differences between the two devices.

Firstly, the leaked specs for Nintendo Switch 2 suggest a slight edge over Valve's Steam Deck in terms of raw processing power (Summary 4). This may give the Switch 2 an advantage when it comes to playing games optimized for its specific architecture. On the other hand, the Steam Deck offers greater flexibility and access to a wider range of games through its storefronts and online platforms.

Secondly, the discussion on PWM technology used in the Steam Deck OLED (Summary 3) highlights potential concerns about screen flicker and viewer comfort. While this analysis is specific to the Steam Deck OLED, it may influence some users' purchasing decisions.

Lastly, the debate among Nintendo Switch Community group members (Summary 5) suggests that the choice between upgrading to the Switch OLED model or waiting for the Switch 2 console depends on individual preferences. Some users prioritize significant improvements over the original Switch, while others value the incremental upgrades offered by the OLED model.

To provide a more definitive answer, additional information would be needed on the following:

1. Specific gaming performance benchmarks for both devices.
2. Comparison of game libraries and storefronts between the two handhelds.
3. User reviews and feedback on the PWM technology used in the Steam Deck OLED to assess its impact on viewer comfort.

In conclusion, while we can identify some differences between the Nintendo Switch 2 and the Steam Deck OLED, a comprehensive comparison requires more detailed information on performance, game libraries, and user experiences.

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is a technology used to adjust brightness on most screens, including the Steam Deck Oled. PWM works by rapidly turning the screen on and off at speeds invisible to the human eye, but can cause flicker that may be noticeable or even uncomfortable for some people. This analysis will use two instruments to measure the PWM of the Steam Deck Oled at different brightness levels, providing a precise assessment of the screen's flicker and potential impact on viewer comfort.
