[Refinement] assasin American history data analysis: This research presents the most detailed evolutionary tree of assassin bugs (Reduviidae) to date, constructed using molecular data from 178 species. The study reveals that key groups within assassin bugs, like the disease-vectoring Triatominae, are more complex in their evolutionary relationships than previously thought, and that blood-feeding likely evolved independently on a few occasions. By combining genetic data with fossil records and behavioral observations, researchers traced the origins of predatory specializations and habitat preferences within this diverse group of insects, pinpointing a major diversification event beginning around 97 million years ago.
