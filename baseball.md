# Research Report

## Research Goal
Who was the best pitcher in the MLB in 2024?

## Executive Summary
### Research Question:
What are the key trends and factors influencing the decline in starting pitcher workloads in Major League Baseball (MLB) over the past decade?

---

### **Response**

#### **1. Overview of the Decline in Starting Pitcher Workloads**
Over the past decade, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers who complete 200 innings in a single season. This trend is evident in the data provided, which shows a significant drop from over 30 pitchers achieving this milestone in 2012 to only 4 in recent years (Logan Webb, Logan Gilbert, Zack Wheeler, and Seth Lugo). Additionally, the average innings pitched per start by starting pitchers has decreased, with teams like the San Francisco Giants averaging just 4.81 innings per start in 2024, compared to the Atlanta Braves' 5.58 innings.

---

#### **2. Key Trends Contributing to the Decline**
Several interconnected trends have contributed to the reduction in starting pitcher workloads:

##### **a. Increased Focus on Pitcher Health and Durability**
- **Pitch Count Management**: Teams have become more cautious about the number of pitches thrown by starting pitchers in a game. This is driven by a better understanding of the relationship between pitch counts and injury risk. Pitchers are often pulled from games before reaching their previous workload thresholds to prevent overuse injuries.
- **Injury Prevention**: The rise in Tommy John surgeries and other arm-related injuries has led teams to adopt more conservative approaches to pitcher usage. This includes limiting innings, reducing the number of starts per season, and implementing rest days between starts.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Advanced metrics such as **Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP)**, **Strikeout-to-Walk Ratio (K/BB)**, and **Velocity Monitoring** have provided teams with insights into pitcher performance and health. These metrics help teams identify when a pitcher may be at risk of injury, prompting earlier removals from games.

##### **b. Evolution of Pitching Strategies**
- **Relief Pitcher Specialization**: Teams are increasingly relying on specialized relief pitchers, such as **closer**, **setup**, and **middle relief** pitchers, to handle high-leverage situations. This reduces the workload on starting pitchers, as they are often pulled before the late innings.
- **Pitcher Flexibility**: The rise of "opener" strategies, where a relief pitcher starts the game and is replaced by the traditional starter in the second inning, has further reduced the innings pitched by starters. This approach allows teams to tailor matchups and manage pitcher fatigue more effectively.
- **Pitcher Workload Distribution**: Teams are spreading out pitching workloads across larger rosters, reducing the reliance on a few high-inning pitchers. This strategy is particularly evident in the use of **bullpens by committee**, where multiple pitchers share the load in relief roles.

##### **c. Rule Changes and Game Length**
- **Shortened Games**: Rule changes aimed at reducing game lengths, such as the **three-batter minimum rule** (introduced in 2020) and **pitch clocks**, have indirectly impacted starting pitcher workloads. These changes have increased the pace of play but also led to more frequent pitching changes, as managers are more inclined to replace starters earlier in games.
- **Increased Action**: The rule changes have also led to more offensive production, which can result in higher pitch counts for starters. This, in turn, prompts earlier removals to prevent fatigue and injury.

##### **d. Player Development and Training**
- **Youth and Inexperience**: Many teams are fielding younger starting pitchers who are still developing their stamina and durability. These pitchers may not yet be capable of handling the high workloads of their predecessors, leading to shorter starts and more frequent relief appearances.
- **Training Methods**: Modern training techniques emphasize **pitcher health** and **longevity** over maximizing short-term performance. This includes focusing on **mechanics**, **strength and conditioning**, and **recovery protocols**, which can limit the number of innings pitched in a season.

##### **e. Managerial and Front-Office Philosophy**
- **Risk Aversion**: Front offices and managers are increasingly risk-averse when it comes to pitcher workloads. The financial investment in top pitchers and the high stakes of the postseason have led teams to prioritize long-term health over short-term performance.
- **Data-Driven Management**: Advanced analytics have empowered front offices to make more informed decisions about pitcher usage. Teams now have access to real-time data on pitch counts, velocity, and fatigue, allowing them to make strategic decisions about when to remove starters.

---

#### **3. Evidence Supporting the Trends**
- **Decline in 200-Inning Pitchers**: As noted, the number of pitchers throwing 200 innings per season has plummeted from over 30 in 2012 to just 4 in recent years. This decline is a direct indicator of the reduced workloads for starting pitchers.
- **Decreased Innings per Start**: Teams like the San Francisco Giants, with an average of 4.81 innings per start in 2024, demonstrate the trend toward shorter starts. This is a significant drop from historical norms, where 6 or 7 innings per start were more common.
- **Increased Reliever Usage**: The rise of specialized relief pitchers and the use of "opener" strategies have shifted the workload from starters to relievers. For example, teams like the Atlanta Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers have built deep bullpens to manage pitching workloads effectively.
- **Injury Rates**: The incidence of arm injuries, such as **Tommy John surgeries**, has remained relatively stable or even decreased, suggesting that the reduced workloads are effective in preventing overuse injuries. However, this also indicates a shift in how teams approach pitcher management.

---

#### **4. Implications and Future Outlook**
The decline in starting pitcher workloads has several implications for the game:
- **Increased Reliance on Bullpens**: Teams are building deeper bullpens to handle the increased workload, leading to more specialized roles and strategies.
- **Shift in Pitcher Development**: Organizations are focusing on developing pitchers who can thrive in shorter, high-leverage appearances rather than traditional long starts.
- **Changing Fan Experience**: Shorter starts and more frequent pitching changes may alter the fan experience, as games become more dynamic but potentially less predictable.

---

#### **5. Conclusion**
The decline in starting pitcher workloads in MLB over the past decade is driven by a combination of factors, including a heightened focus on pitcher health, evolving pitching strategies, rule changes, and data-driven decision-making. Teams are prioritizing long-term health and performance, leading to shorter starts, increased reliance on bullpens, and more conservative pitcher management. While this approach has its benefits, such as reduced injury rates, it also marks a significant shift in how the game is played and managed.

---

### **Final Answer**
The key trends influencing the decline in starting pitcher workloads in MLB over the past decade include **increased focus on pitcher health and durability**, **evolution of pitching strategies**, **rule changes and game length adjustments**, **modern player development methods**, and **data-driven management philosophies**. These factors have collectively led to shorter starts, reduced innings pitched, and a greater reliance on bullpens. **$\boxed{\text{These trends reflect a shift toward prioritizing pitcher health and long-term sustainability over traditional high-workload approaches.}}$**
