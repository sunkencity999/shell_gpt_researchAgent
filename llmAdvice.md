## Research Goal
Which Open Source LLM is the right choice for a small business with limited resources?

## Executive Summary
I apologize, but I was unable to find relevant information to answer your research question: "Which Open Source LLM is the right choice for a small business with limited resources?"

The search results contained content that was not related to your specific question. This could be due to:
1. Limited availability of specific data on this topic
2. Search queries not targeting the right sources
3. The information you're looking for may require access to specialized databases

**Suggestions:**
- Try rephrasing your research question with more specific terms
- Consider breaking down your question into smaller, more focused parts
- Look for official sources like team websites, MLB.com, or sports statistics databases

**Alternative approach:** You might want to search for specific statistics like "LA Dodgers wins 2015-2024" or "SF Giants playoff appearances this decade" to get more targeted results.
